# javascript-examples
Just some code i wrote in various places and some i am still building on. Will be using this page to showcase the knowledge i have in Js and give proof that i can actually write in the language.

Coding styling and other factors that differ across teams can be implemented once i find one i personally like...stuck between AirBNB & Standard.

# customTag.js
Will use this Js code to eventually build a custom tag in Django.

# body.js
Wrote object functions and classes in C++...Will port over to Js then continue working on functionality.

# selectView.js
Contains scripts for: 
1) Hiding/showing a view.
2) Selecting specific views based on type & tag clicked.
3) Scrolling to the top of page.
4) Loading a different background color on elements on window load.
