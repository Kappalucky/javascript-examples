# Javascript Examples
Just some code i wrote in various places and some i am still building on. Will be using this page to showcase the knowledge i have in Js and give proof that i can actually write in the language.

Coding styling and other factors that differ across teams can be implemented once i find one i personally like...stuck between AirBNB & Standard.

# validation.js
General validation function to check if input is Ascii and if: 
1) Zip
2) Email
3) Password
4) Date
5) Phone number

are valid.

Includes the option to return object 'person' containing validated information for passing to back-end.
Script also binds to submit button and/or bind to 'input' in form labels for error styling purposes.

# carousel.js
Carousel base function that uses Django template language to query information from back-end.

The function adds the data to an array for users to look through on the clientside. Whether the arrows are clicked or image/tabs pressed, the order will be the same.
# selectView.js
Contains scripts for: 
1) Hiding/showing a view.
2) Selecting specific views based on type & tag clicked.
3) Scrolling to the top of page.
4) Loading a different background color on elements on window load.

# customTag.js
Will use this Js code to eventually build a custom tag in Django.

# body.js
Wrote object functions and classes in C++...Will port over to Js then continue working on functionality.
