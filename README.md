# javascript-examples
Just some code i wrote in various places and some i am still building on. Will be using this page to showcase the knowledge i have in Js and give proof that i can actually write in the language.

Coding styling and other factors that differ across teams can be implemented once i find one i personally like...stuck between AirBNB & Standard.

# CustomTag.js
Will use this Js code to eventually build a custom tag in Django

# Body.js
Wrote object functions and classes in C++...Will port over to Js then continue working on functionality
